## About

A Flutter app to train chess visualization for players with aphantasia

## Article

A Flutter-based chess visualization training app targeting people with aphantasia or who struggle with visualization. The README is boilerplate Flutter starter text, so it's hard to assess implementation depth from the repo alone. The concept is solid—chess visualization is a learnable skill and targeting people who struggle with it is thoughtful. Need to see more of the actual app.
