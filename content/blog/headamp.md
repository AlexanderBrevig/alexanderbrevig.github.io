## About

Simple hifi headphone amplifier

## Article

A personal headphone amp project—likely built for your own use. Audio amplifiers are well-established; building one is fine, but without unusual design choices or thorough documentation about the approach, it's just another amp. It's useful to you, which matters, but not particularly interesting to the broader electronics community.
