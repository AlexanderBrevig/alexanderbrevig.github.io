## About

Just a collection of my personal dotfiles

## Article

Personal dotfiles using GNU Stow. It's a common pattern—lots of people publish their dotfiles—but on its own it's not particularly interesting. The value in dotfiles is entirely dependent on: (1) whether your specific setup solves unique problems, or (2) whether they're *exceptionally* well-documented. This one is just "here's my setup." Unless you're doing exactly what this person does, there's not much to learn here.
