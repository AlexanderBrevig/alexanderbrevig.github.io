## About

Gruvbox for KiCAD - THE FUTURE IS HERE

## Article

A port of the popular Gruvbox color scheme to KiCAD. It's your daily-driver theme, which means you've actually used and refined it. Useful for KiCAD users who like Gruvbox. It solves the "I want my CAD tool to match my editor color scheme" problem. Narrow appeal, but well-executed.
