## About

11 Eurorack modules - a complete modular synth voice

## Article

Designing and building a full Eurorack synth system is ambitious. The README shows detailed planning: voice modules (VCO, VCA, filter, ADSR), modulation (LFO, envelope), extras (noise, distortion, fold), and comprehensive parts lists. This isn't just theoretical—you've thought through actual component selection, suppliers, and build sequencing. The fact that you're using your own KiCAD library (ABKiCADLibs) shows you're building a reusable infrastructure. If you've actually built these modules and they work, that's impressive. If they're designs waiting to be built, they're still a solid example of understanding analog synth architecture from first principles.
