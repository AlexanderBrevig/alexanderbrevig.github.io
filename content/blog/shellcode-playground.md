## About

A playground for experimenting writing shellcode

## Article

A setup for building and testing x86/x86_64 shellcode—you gathered existing shellcodes, added comments, and created a Makefile-based sandbox to experiment. This is genuinely useful for anyone learning low-level code or security. The fact that you documented it and made it easy to add new shellcodes shows pedagogical thinking. It's not research-level work, but it's a solid learning/reference resource.
