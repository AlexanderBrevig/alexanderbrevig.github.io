## About

A system to play backing tracks, click track, MIDI and DMX - one stop shop for a modern band

## Article

LiveArmada is an ambitious product idea—a unified system for modern bands to manage backing tracks, click tracks, MIDI routing, and DMX lighting, all from one place. That's a real pain point for live musicians, and building a solution shows you understand the workflow. The README is minimal and the repo looks like an early-stage product/hardware development, but the concept is solid and addresses an actual need. If you've actually used this in live situations, that's validation. The main question is: how complete and reliable is it?
