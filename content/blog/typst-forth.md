## About

Forth syntax highlighting for Typst

## Article

A syntax highlighter for Forth in Typst. Published on Typst's package registry. Useful if you're writing Forth documentation in Typst (which, given your other Forth projects, you probably are). It's narrow in scope but solves the exact problem someone needs when writing about Forth.
