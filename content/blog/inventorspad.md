## About

Open Source Inventor's Notepad

## Article

A physical notepad published on Lulu for makers and inventors—kind of a project documentation/sketching tool in paper form. It's a neat idea for the maker community, but there's not much code here to dig into. It's more of a published product than a software project. Cool that you created it, but not the kind of thing that would have people scrambling to learn from or fork your work.
