A guitar pedal circuit design based on well-established distortion/overdrive topologies. You took proven circuit knowledge and created a well-documented variation—good for breadboarding or building a permanent enclosure. The heavy commenting is genuinely helpful for someone learning analog circuit design. But the space of guitar effects circuits is well-explored territory. This is competent execution of established techniques rather than novel exploration.
