## About

Utility for Unity3D that adds a [GetComponent] annotation for automatically searching and setting a field

## Article

A simple but handy tool for Unity developers—just slap `[GetComponent]` on a field and it gets populated in Awake. It cuts down boilerplate in MonoBehaviours, and any Unity dev who's written `GetComponent<>()` a hundred times will appreciate it. It's not groundbreaking, but it's the kind of quality-of-life improvement that actually makes development faster. If you're building tools for your own projects, this is a good template.
