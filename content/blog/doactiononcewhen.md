A micro-utility for firing an action exactly once when a condition becomes true. The FizzBuzz example in the README is the perfect use case—and also the most interesting you can get with this idea. It solves a tiny, specific problem that's useful in some game loops or state machines. But honestly, this is the kind of thing you write inline when you need it rather than pulling in a library. Useful? Yes. Reusable? Only for that one case.
