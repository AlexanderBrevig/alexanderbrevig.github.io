## About

(site) app to train visualization for aphantasia or beginners that struggle to "see" FEN moves

## Article

A landing page for the InnerChess mobile app—a vibrant, mobile-responsive site. It's nice marketing, but it's just a landing page. The interesting work is in the actual app, not the static website for it.
