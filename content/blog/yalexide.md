## About

An IDE for development of yalex scripts

## Article

A companion IDE for yalex—still very much a work in progress, which is honest. Building an IDE is substantial work, and you clearly started on this but didn't take it to completion. The concept is solid (why wouldn't you want a dedicated editor for your own language?), and the fact that you built on top of previous work shows pragmatism. It's interesting as a project, but incomplete projects are harder to learn from or use.
