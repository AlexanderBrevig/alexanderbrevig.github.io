## About

Book project on the art of mixing live audio

## Article

A book project about live audio mixing. Very little code here—it's a TeX document. If it's a finished book on mixing, it could be genuinely useful for engineers. If it's a work-in-progress, it's less interesting in a software context. The repository doesn't tell us much about the scope or depth of the content. Without being able to see the actual material, it's hard to assess beyond "audio mixing knowledge is valuable to people in that field."
