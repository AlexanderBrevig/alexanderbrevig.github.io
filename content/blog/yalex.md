## About

minimalist functional scripting language for embedded systems

## Article

This is one of those fun esoteric language projects—a stack-based functional language inspired by Forth, designed to be minimal enough for embedded systems. The README does a great job showing side-by-side Fibonacci implementations in yalex vs C, which really illustrates the mental model shift. It's not a language that's going to replace Lua on microcontrollers, but it shows real language design thinking. The fact that you made it configurable and created an IDE for it shows you took it seriously. Not many people actually *make* languages, so there's something here worth exploring if you're into language design.
