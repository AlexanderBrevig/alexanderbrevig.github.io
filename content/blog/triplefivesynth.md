## About

One 555 per pitch oscillator

## Article

A creative hardware synth design: use one 555 timer IC per MIDI note to create a polyphonic oscillator. It's unconventional—most people use integrated synth chips or complicated analog circuits. This is elegant in its simplicity and shows real understanding of both 555 timers and what it takes to build synthesizers. The Rust code that calculates trim values for each frequency is the cherry on top. It's a work-in-progress, but the idea and execution show genuine creativity. This is the kind of project that makes other electronics folks go "huh, I never thought of that."
