## About

Easily enable your static functions to be CLI callable

## Article

Add an attribute to a static method, call one setup function, and suddenly your CLI app just works. It's a nice convenience layer—saves you from writing boilerplate argument parsing for every little utility. Useful? Sure. Innovative? Not really. This is the kind of solution people come up with when they get tired of writing the same CLI scaffolding over and over. It works well for what it does, but it's solving a solved problem.
