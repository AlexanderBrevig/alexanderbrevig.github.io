## About

tree-sitter grammar for taskwarrior

## Article

A tree-sitter grammar for taskwarrior's task file format—making `task N edit` look nice in tree-sitter-powered editors. This is useful if you're a taskwarrior user with a fancy editor setup. It's well-scoped, does exactly what it says, and would be appreciated by the taskwarrior community. But it's a narrow tool for a narrow audience. Nice implementation, but not the kind of project that opens doors or teaches broader concepts.
