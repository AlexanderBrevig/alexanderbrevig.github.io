## About

Make any unicode string conform to [a..zA..Z], keep whitespace and symbols/numbers

## Article

Unicode normalization for those times when you need to strip diacritics and convert everything to ASCII-friendly characters. It's a specific tool for a specific job—if you need it, you'll know. But it's not the kind of thing that makes for interesting conversation. It works, it's published on NuGet, and people who need it will find it. That's about it.
