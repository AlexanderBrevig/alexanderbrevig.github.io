## About

C# SuperSimple PubSub implementation

## Article

A minimal pub/sub system in C# that lets you subscribe and publish to events via a dictionary-like interface. It's straightforward and it works, but pub/sub is such a well-trodden path that this doesn't stand out. If you're building something in C# and need lightweight event dispatch, there are many options here and many other places. Nothing wrong with it, just nothing remarkable.
